# DLBA
my code for building the Detroit Land Bank Authority's (DLBA) occupancy model

-MCM_DFD_H2O_DTE_combine_090416.R program builds the model on the training data and validates it with the test data


-fitting_randomTree_model_to_full_data_090416.R applies the model built in the previous program to the entire superset of all residential properties (non-apartment buildings) for the entire city of Detroit
